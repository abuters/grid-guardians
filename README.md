## Game Overview

**Grid Guardians** is an educational and action-packed arcade game where you defend a modern electrical grid from waves of fossil fuel emissions. As the grid, you must dodge, shoot, and power up to protect renewable infrastructure and push back against pollution. The game features a vibrant outdoor environment, realistic wind turbines and solar farms, and a dramatic boss battle against a fossil fuel power plant.

## Technical Implementation

- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Framework:** [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for rendering and game loop
- **Single-file HTML:** All logic in `index.html` for easy deployment
- **No dependencies:** Only `p5.min.js` is required

### Key Features
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Classes for Player, Enemy, PowerUp, Particle, Explosion, etc.
- **Custom Drawing:** All visuals are rendered with p5.js drawing commands (no image assets)
- **Animations:** Smooth movement, explosions, damage flashes, and environmental effects
- **Thematic Consistency:** All visuals and mechanics reinforce the decarbonisation theme

## Development Process Using AI Tools

This game was developed with the assistance of advanced AI coding tools, which enabled:
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Fast iteration on gameplay, visuals, and mechanics
- **Thematic Overhaul:** Transforming a space shooter into a decarbonisation/energy defense game
- **Visual Polish:** AI-generated code for realistic wind turbines, solar farms, and enemy designs
- **Feature Expansion:** Adding new power-ups, UI elements, and accessibility improvements
- **Code Review:** AI-assisted refactoring and bug fixing

**AI tools used:**
- Code generation and refactoring
- Thematic brainstorming and visual design
- Automated documentation and planning

## Extending the Game

Want to add your own features? Hereâ€™s how to get started:

### 1. Add New Enemies or Power-Ups
- Create a new class or extend the `Enemy` or `PowerUp` class in `index.html`
- Add new types to the enemy or power-up spawning logic

### 2. Enhance Visuals
- Modify the drawing code in the relevant class (`drawWindTurbines`, `drawSolarFarm`, etc.)
- Use p5.js drawing functions for custom shapes and effects

### 3. Add Sound or Music
- Integrate the [p5.sound library](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound)
- Trigger sounds on events (shoot, explosion, power-up, etc.)

### 4. Implement New Game Modes
- Add new states or screens (e.g., endless mode, challenge mode)
- Adjust the main game loop and UI to support mode selection

### 5. Improve Accessibility
- Add colorblind-friendly modes
- Support keyboard remapping

### 6. Refactor for Modularity
- Move classes to separate JS files for larger projects
- Add a build system if needed (Webpack, Vite, etc.)

---

## Running & Testing

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
2. **Play!** No build step required.

### Unit Testing

For logic testing, consider using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).  
Example test file structure:
```
/__tests__/game.test.js
```
(See the codebase for sample tests.)
